* Others
** don't use scale for the tps - for small everything should be in one texture
** Collect stars to unlock campaigns
** Implementation of the texture definition should be able to work with only one of them being available (big/small stuff)

* Map
** indicator for being almost dead (red screen?)
** indicator for where the packagetarget is (arrow?)
** wind indicator
** visual indicator for the flying npc and the fish (ClientMap::spawnInfo)
** powerups (from tree)
*** kill or stun dinos you are touching while an effect is active
*** reduce collision damage
*** packages are easier to carry (reduced weight)
** finish lava
** fix zooming for some maps (e.g. last map of first campaign)

* CaveExpress
** Jungle theme
** Liana graphics (we only have one)
** check apple weight - doesn't swim on the water - the banana does

* Cavepacker
** sound if you hit the best points available

* UI:
** text length for bitmap font rendering (e.g. to render background color of a button)
   is not taking the utf8 length into account
