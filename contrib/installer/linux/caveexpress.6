.SH NAME
caveexpress \- 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcaveexpress\fR [\fIoption\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCaveexpress\fP is a classic 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay and
dozens of levels. Master your pedal-powered flying machine to pick up packages
from your cave-dwelling clients and drop them off at the collection point.

But beware! Mighty mastodons, terrifying pterodactyls and others would rather
see you extinct.
